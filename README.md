# What is this?
This is my [neovim](https://neovim.io/) configuration based on [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).

## Pre-Lazy
Feel free to clone it or use it as a reference
If you need reference for a setup without **Lazy.vim** checkout the [pre-lazy](https://github.com/DrGGCoolman/nvim/tree/pre-lazy) branch in this repo.
